# Plant Company Performance Report

## Overview

In global manufacturing, monitoring production volume and quantity variances is critical for maintaining supply chain efficiency and meeting market demand. This project addresses this by developing a Quantity Performance Report in Power BI that provides a deep dive into the Plant Co. global operations dataset. By engineering complex DAX measures, the report enables a side-by-side comparison of Year-to-Date (YTD) performance against Prior Year-to-Date (PYTD) benchmarks, allowing stakeholders to immediately identify growth or decline across different time periods.

The technical architecture focuses on user-centric design, featuring a dynamic "switch" logic that allows users to toggle between various KPIs within the same visual framework. Additionally, the dashboard incorporates a Decomposition Tree to perform granular root-cause analysis, breaking down quantity metrics by country, product type, and plant location. This project demonstrates an end-to-end BI solution—from data modeling to advanced visualization—designed to support strategic operational decision-making.
